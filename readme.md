# LTILib

	A PHP library for LTI providers for communication over the [Full LTI specification](http://www.imsglobal.org/lti/index.html).
	Because the Full LTI specification is not fully public, this library is unfinished but should provide a good starting point for
	any PHP applications serving as LTI providers.
